# Technical University of Crete - HPY414 - Assignment 6
This is an assignment I completed as an undergraduate student in Technical University of Crete.

In the "implementation.zip" file, you will find:
- Two ".txt" files with domain names and/or IP addresses.
- A bash script that you need to run as sudo user. (Use "sudo ./adblock.sh -help" for help)
- A README file that explains the funcionality of the bash script.

With the functionality implemented, you will be able to create a simple firewall in your ubuntu machine with the purpose of rejecting connection to unwanted hosts and IP addresses.
